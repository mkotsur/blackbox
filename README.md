A platform that helps to facilitate responsible access to collected and archived datasets within your organization. It reduces the margin of risk and increases control, trust and awareness among data providers and consumers. Blackbox helps handle data, models and algorithms more responsibly and bring the dilemmas of data protection from moral into practical plain and decide what the rules and responsibilities should be per-project.

## The big picture

<p>
Companies are increasingly coming under fire for the way they use data. Governments have amended many laws and regulations in response to this. GDPR law protects everyone's privacy. Under this law, the invasion of privacy or personal information leakage is punishable with heavy fines.
</p>

<p>
Values ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as "public safety" and "privacy" often conflict. Dilemmas arise when more weight is attached to one concept than another. Therefore, every good data analyst should have virtues such as "respect for the sensitivity of personal data" and "prudence and selectivity in communicating and sharing that data". Education and training in such virtues are crucial. Yet, the environment and technical facilities play a vital role in the ability of data professionals to make responsible choices as well.
